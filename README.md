# visionOS

I’ve completed integrating the core features into the US Citizenship Civics Test Preparation app I had created for the visionOS.

✅ “Study Mode" and "Recall Mode":
In "Study Mode," you can see the questions and answers at the same time, while in "Reçall Mode," the answers are only displayed after the "Show Answer" button is clicked.
✅ Physical keyboard input now works in the question search field.
✅ Made the text more legible and added an app icon.

I used Xcode and Reality Composer Pro to create the app.
